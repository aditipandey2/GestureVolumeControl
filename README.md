# GestureVolumeControl
GestureVolumeControl is a Python application designed for an interactive and hands-free volume control experience. By leveraging the capabilities of the Mediapipe and PyCaw libraries, this project enables you to control your system's volume using intuitive hand gestures captured through your webcam.

#Requirements
Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed before running the application:

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

Mediapipe (pip install mediapipe)

PyCaw (pip install PyCaw)

#How to Use
Execute the HandGestureVolumeControl.py script.
Set up your webcam correctly.
Utilize hand gestures in front of the webcam to seamlessly control the system volume.

#Gesture Recognition
The application recognizes hand gestures, specifically the positioning of your thumb and index finger, to dynamically adjust the volume. Bring your thumb and index finger closer to decrease the volume, and move them apart to increase the volume.

#Controls
Press 'q' to exit the application gracefully.
